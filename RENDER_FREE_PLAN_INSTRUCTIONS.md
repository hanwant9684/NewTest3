# How to Check Memory Debug Log on Render FREE PLAN

## 🎯 The Solution - No Shell Access Needed!

Since Render's free plan doesn't have Shell access, I've created a **web page** where you can view and download the memory debug log directly from your browser.

## 📍 How to Access the Memory Log

### Step 1: Get Your Render URL

Your bot is deployed at a URL like:
```
https://your-bot-name.onrender.com
```

Find this URL in your Render dashboard.

### Step 2: Add `/memory-debug` to the URL

Open your browser and go to:
```
https://your-bot-name.onrender.com/memory-debug
```

### Step 3: View the Log

You'll see a nice web page with:
- ✅ The complete memory debug log
- ✅ "Copy All" button - Click to copy everything to clipboard
- ✅ "Download" button - Download as a file
- ✅ "Refresh" button - Reload to see latest data

## 🚨 After a Memory Crash - What to Do

### 1. Wait for Render to Restart Your Bot
- Render will automatically restart after crash
- Wait 1-2 minutes for it to come back online

### 2. Visit the Memory Debug Page
```
https://your-bot-name.onrender.com/memory-debug
```

### 3. The Log Shows What Happened BEFORE the Crash
The memory log file **persists through crashes**, so you'll see:
- 🚨 CRITICAL warnings right before the crash
- The last 5 operations before running out of memory
- Exactly what was using RAM (sessions, downloads, cache)

### 4. Copy and Share With Me

Click the **"📋 Copy All to Clipboard"** button, then paste it here so I can help you fix the issue.

## 📸 Example of What You'll See

The page will show something like:

```

## 🔧 What to Look For in the Log

### Problem: Too Many Sessions
```
Sessions: 4 or more
```
**Fix needed**: Session limit not working (should be max 3 on Render)

### Problem: Too Many Downloads
```
Active DLs: 4 or more
```
**Fix needed**: Download queue allowing too many concurrent

### Problem: Memory Not Freed
```
[14:40] Download Completed - 300 MB
[14:45] Still at 300 MB  ← Should have decreased!
```
**Fix needed**: Files not being cleaned up

### Problem: Gradual Memory Leak
```
[10:00] Periodic: 150 MB
[11:00] Periodic: 200 MB
[12:00] Periodic: 250 MB  ← Constantly increasing
```
**Fix needed**: Something accumulating over time
